## Features

- 🤖 Everything runs inside the browser with **no server support** and is **accelerated with WebGPU**.

- ⚙️ Model runs in a web worker, ensuring that it doesn't block the user interface and providing a seamless experience.

- 🚀 Easy to deploy for free with one-click on Vercel in under 1 minute, then you get your own ChatLLM Web.

- 💾 Model caching is supported, so you only need to download the model once.

- 💬 Multi-conversation chat, with all data stored locally in the browser for privacy.

- 📝 Markdown and streaming response support: math, code highlighting, etc.

- 🎨 responsive and well-designed UI, including dark mode.

- 💻 PWA supported, download it and run totally offline.

## Instructions

- 🌐 To use this app, you need a browser that supports WebGPU, such as Chrome 113 or Chrome Canary. Chrome versions ≤ 112 are not supported.

- 💻 You will need a GPU with about 6.4GB of memory. If your GPU has less memory, the app will still run, but the response time will be slower.

- 📥 The first time you use the app, you will need to download the model. For the Vicuna-7b model that we are currently using, the download size is about 4GB. After the initial download, the model will be loaded from the browser cache for faster usage.
